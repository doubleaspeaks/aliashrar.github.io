								<p>My motto is not to old to learn and not to young to run. I try to achive excellence in whatever interests I have no matter how small it might be. I'm passionate about tech and love to build websites, make apps and make programs that make life easy! I work in studied in vastly diffrent fields, and I hope to bring togather my experiences in those fields into a cohesive whole. Although
									I always been fascinated by tech, I never actually took any initative to take part in it, until 2020, where the onset of the pandemic gave me the push I needed to finally start  my studies in Computer Science. I love the entrepreneurial spirit
									hence my degree in business, and I also love film, which is why I chose to study in it, but my true passion always lied in tech and now with the world increasingly becoming smaller and more tech focused, I feel it is my duty to be a part of this
									endevor and do my part in helping this world through technology. I hope to make a diffrence using my skills in the areas of Software development, Engeenering and Maths, be it in the field of tech, gaming or even film.
